Focused on doing it right the first time, we continue to pursue the highest quality of life for all – something we call... “The Temecula Way” lighting 2040 the path to 4 The Temecula Quality of Life Master Plan (QLMP) 2040 is a visionary and living document created to express the aspirations, ideals, and strategic priorities of the City and community. This second edition continues the successful path established by our predecessors in 2009, when the City marked its 20-year incorporation anniversary.

Throughout this transition Temecula retained its small town feel and character even in the midst of strong population and economic growth. Throughout the past ten years, the QLMP has been a very successful tool for City goal setting and project implementation. All City Departments maintain performance indicators based on the QLMP Core Values and all Capital Improvement Projects are evaluated in terms of their adherence to the QLMP values. The original QLMP was intended as a 20 year plan, but many of the goals and project priorities have already been accomplished. City leaders, anticipating the larger general plan update, determined that this was an important opportunity to update the QLMP to help set the stage for that comprehensive planning process. The first and second editions of the QLMP are framed between a series of major economic and social disruptions. In 2009, the Great Recession resulted in one of the worst economic declines in United States history. In 2020, as the City embarked on the QLMP update, the COVID-19 pandemic, in conjunction with a national social justice movement, culminated in historical socio- economic impacts that challenged basic health, cultural, and societal norms. Never one to shy away from a leadership role, the City and community engaged in difficult conversations and strategic actions to ensure a high quality of life for those who choose to live, work, visit,  and play in Temecula. The City’s commitment to strong fiscal stewardship and inclusiveness regardless of race, ethnicity, or ability, has helped the community navigate through the pandemic and emerge even stronger. With a renewed strength and resolve to maintain our local control and high quality of life, Temecula is dedicated to building a',\n",

The BRC held several meetings to review each Core Value, consider new data on population and economic trends, and to discuss evolving issues and conditions in Temecula that should be addressed in the updated QLMP. The QLMP process was supported by the consulting team of Applied Development Economics and Moore lacofano Goltsman, both California firms with extensive experience in long term strategic planning processes and community engagement. The project team conducted an online survey of residents which supplemented the True North Survey and provided com- munity input specifically on the QLMP Core Values and related issues. Other community outreach during the process included: • Pop-up Events in which the team set up booths at community events and solicited input from event participants. • A DEDICATED Project Web page where members of the public could learn more about the QLMP 2040, watch video recordings of each BRC meeting and stay engaged in the process. • Public Workshops to engage the community, conducted both in person and online. COMMUNITY INPUT Community Survey The City of Temecula regularly engages a third party to conduct community surveys of citizen satisfaction, priorities, and concerns on a variety of services that the City provides. Survey methodology combines mail and telephone recruiting strategies with online data collection to ensure accessibility and statistically reliable samples. The most recent survey was conducted in Spring 2021. The results of the survey for topics relevant to the QLMP are provided throughout this document.

Among other benefits, this will help facilitate electronic workflow management, greatly increasing efficiency\"** (efficiency allows for more funds to be alloted elsewhere)\\n\\n**Implicit Policies (Inferences):**\\n\\n*   **Provide consistently professional services and information to customers and constituents.** (It can be inferenced that this could mean accurate and updated information about wildfire danger, evacuation protocols, and defensible space guidelines to residents.)\\n*   **\"Maintain a flexible organization which responds to the changing needs and priorities of the community\"** (Implies the ability to adapt strategies and resources to address emerging threats like increasing wildfire risk due to climate change.)\\n*   **\"Provide the highest quality of service at the most cost-effective rate while being fiscally responsible\"** (Implies a commitment to efficiently using resources for effective fire prevention and response.)\\n*   **Ensure transparency in all aspects of City government** (transparency would let citizens know what the government is doing in terms of prevention and mitigation)\\n*   **Maintain staffing levels necessary to deliver desired service levels to residents** (Sufficient staffing ensures that emergency services, including fire departments, can adequately respond to incidents, including wildfires.)\\n\\n**Important Considerations:**\\n\\n*   **Context is Key:** Without knowing the specific location and its wildfire risk profile, it\\'s difficult to definitively say which policies are directly intended for wildfire resilience.\\n*   **Broad Goals:** Many of these policies are broad and indirectly contribute to resilience. The actual impact depends on how they are implemented.\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Line 38:\\nBased on the text provided, here are the explicit and implicit policies related to wildfire resilience and/or mitigation. Note that since the text provided does not directly mention wildfire resilience and/or mitigation, I can only infer implicit policies from the document\\'s broader goals and priorities.\\n\\n**Please be aware that these are inferred based on general principles and may not be directly applicable to wildfire issues.**\\n\\n**Explicit Policies (None Directly Mentioned):**\\n\\n*   There are no explicit policies related to wildfire resilience and/or mitigation in the provided text.\\n\\n**Implicit Policies (Inferred):**\\n\\nThese are inferred from the document\\'s broader emphasis on equity, community involvement, and resource allocation.\\n\\n*   **Resource Allocation based on Need:** (Inferred from: \"inequity gaps are closed through appropriate resource allocation, enhanced programs, and service delivery.\") *This suggests that resources should be directed to address areas of greatest need within the community. In the context of wildfire, this could mean allocating resources to vulnerable populations or areas with higher wildfire risk.*\\n*   **Inclusive Policy Making:** (Inferred from: \"Provide for diversity, inclusion in events, services, programs, policies 59.3% Residents satisfaction with City efforts to provide for diversity, inclusion in events, services, programs, policies 70.6%\") *This indicates that policies should be developed with input from a diverse range of community members. In wildfire resilience, this could mean considering the needs and perspectives of different groups when developing evacuation plans or mitigation strategies.*\\n*   **Regular Policy Review and Updates:** (Inferred from: \"Policies are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure community satisfaction and a high quality of life remain at the forefront.\") *This implies a commitment to adapting policies to changing circumstances and community needs. In the context of wildfire, this could mean updating evacuation plans or building codes based on new research or experiences from past fires.*\\n*   **Prioritizing Vulnerable Populations:** (Inferred from: \"Expand programs and services to those with special needs 70.7%\") *This indicates a commitment to supporting residents with special needs. Wildfire policies need to specifically cater for residents with special needs.*\\n*   **Focus on Equity:** (Inferred from: \"THE CITY OF TEMECULA SUPPORTS THE FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS IN A JUST SOCIETY.\") *This could relate to equitable distribution of resources for mitigation, ensuring access to information and assistance during wildfires for all residents, and addressing disparities in wildfire impacts among different groups.*\\n\\n**Important Note:** These are inferences. To confirm whether these are intended as explicit or implicit policies related to wildfire resilience, you would need to consult additional documents or information from the City of Temecula.\\n\\n',\n",
